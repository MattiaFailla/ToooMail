# An announcement

This application is currently semi-functional, but given the limitations of the distribution of a python application we have decided to rewrite the whole application with Electron. Python was an experiment, fun, instructive but unsustainable.
We hope that electron will bring many talented programmers closer and that it will allow us a more agile and simple development.
